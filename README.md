# shiny
This repository contains one app.R file, covid19.csv file, diabetes.csv file, and image th.jpg in www folder. 
In this shiny app, the date rang (start date must be earlier than the end date otherwise an error will be appeared) and the country will be selected, and then the data will be appeared on lineplot.
If you click in the box of the line plot, y (covid19 cases) will be shown on the box in the bottom of the line plot. 
There is a mooving average option in the right box that can be selected and the size can be chosen.
The second part is another scatter plot with diabetes dataset. You can select x variable and y variable and see the plot.
Data are attached in my Github account, and the websites the data are gathered from are tagged in the app.
The theme can be changed from the top-right of the app.
